# Lab Instructions: Type Casting Input

In this lab you will be presented with three exercises to demonstrate how explicit type casting can be.  
used to solve data being inputted from an end user. Each exercise will ask you to solve a particular problem relating to types.
 <br>

## There are two exercises and objectives of this activity: 
- **Exercise 1:** Use explicit casting to apply the correct cast type

- **Exercise 2:** Fix the script so it correctly outputs the bill total <br><br>

## Exercise 1:
In this exercise, you'll use explicit casting to apply the correct cast type.

### Instructions

1. Open the script exercise1.py present inside the project folder


2. To run the script, open terminal and execute the following command:
    ```
    python3 exercise1.py
    ```
3. Step 3: Fix the script so the variables have the correct type.


## Exercise 2:

Your goal of this exercise is to fix the script so that each variable has the correct type.

### Instructions

1. Open the script exercise2.py present inside the project folder

2. To run the script, open terminal and execute the following command.  You will be prompted to enter some values.


    ```
    python3 exercise2.py
